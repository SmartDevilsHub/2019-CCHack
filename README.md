# Lightning Net

Lightning Net connects people who are concerned about sustainability. We provide a simple and efficient way to share and distribute electricity between households that have renewable energy sources at their disposal. You left home for vacation and are not using any of the energy your solar panels are generating? You decided to throw a huge party but your wind turbine is not powerful enough? Lightning Net is the solution you are looking for!



## How It Works

Every house that wants to be connected to the network, has to have a source of renewable energy. We come over, install some hardware, configure software, and wire you up. Now you're in! Raspberry Pi's controll your power consumption to prevent your battery from overflowing or supply more energy if you need it. Our web server calculates the most efficient way to destribute energy throughout the network and talk to your particular Pi to make it send or receive electricity.
